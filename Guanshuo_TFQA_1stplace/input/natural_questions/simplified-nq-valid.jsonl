For other uses , see Tradewind . The westerlies ( blue arrows ) and trade winds ( yellow and brown arrows ) <P> The trade winds are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics , within the lower portion of the Earth 's atmosphere , in the lower section of the troposphere near the Earth 's equator . The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere , strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase . Trade winds have been used by captains of sailing ships to cross the world 's oceans for centuries , and enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . </P> <P> In meteorology , the trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic , Pacific , and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America , Southeast Asia , and Madagascar and eastern Africa , respectively . Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea , as well as portions of southeastern North America . Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes , and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion , which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge . The weaker the trade winds become , the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Cause </Li> <Li> 3 Weather effects </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> A Spanish galleon See also : Age of Discovery , Volta do Mar , and Age of sail <P> The term trade winds originally derives from the early fourteenth century late Middle English word ' trade , ' meaning `` path '' or `` track . '' The Portuguese recognized the importance of the trade winds ( then the Volta do mar , meaning in Portuguese `` turn of the sea '' but also `` return from the sea '' ) in navigation in both the north and south Atlantic ocean as early as the 15th century . From West Africa , the Portuguese had to sail away from continental Portugal , that is , to west and northwest . They could then turn northeast , to the area around the Azores islands , and finally east to mainland Europe . They also learned that to reach South Africa , they needed to go far out in the ocean , head for Brazil , and around 30 ° S go east again . Following the African coast southbound means upwind in the Southern hemisphere . In the Pacific ocean , the full wind circulation , which included both the trade wind easterlies and higher - latitude Westerlies , was unknown to Europeans until Andres de Urdaneta 's voyage in 1565 . </P> <P> The captain of a sailing ship seeks a course along which the winds can be expected to blow in the direction of travel . During the Age of Sail , the pattern of prevailing winds made various points of the globe easy or difficult to access , and therefore had a direct effect on European empire - building and thus on modern political geography . For example , Manila galleons could not sail into the wind at all . </P> <P> By the 18th century the importance of the trade winds to England 's merchant fleet for crossing the Atlantic Ocean had led both the general public and etymologists to identify the name with a later meaning of ' trade ' , `` ( foreign ) commerce '' . Between 1847 and 1849 , Matthew Fontaine Maury collected enough information to create wind and current charts for the world 's oceans . </P> <H2> Cause ( edit ) </H2> 3D map showing Hadley cells in relationship to trade winds on the surface . See also : Air mass , Hadley cell , Humidity , Intertropical Convergence Zone , Monsoon , Monsoon trough , Near - equatorial trough , and Prevailing winds <P> As part of the Hadley cell circulation , surface air flows toward the equator while the flow aloft is towards the poles . A low - pressure area of calm , light variable winds near the equator is known as the doldrums , near - equatorial trough , intertropical front , or the Intertropical Convergence Zone . When located within a monsoon region , this zone of low pressure and wind convergence is also known as the monsoon trough . Around 30 ° in both hemispheres , air begins to descend toward the surface in subtropical high - pressure belts known as subtropical ridges . The subsident ( sinking ) air is relatively dry because as it descends , the temperature increases , but the absolute humidity remains constant , which lowers the relative humidity of the air mass . This warm , dry air is known as a superior air mass and normally resides above a maritime tropical ( warm and moist ) air mass . An increase of temperature with height is known as a temperature inversion . When it occurs within a trade wind regime , it is known as a trade wind inversion . </P> <P> The surface air that flows from these subtropical high - pressure belts toward the Equator is deflected toward the west in both hemispheres by the Coriolis effect . These winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere . Because winds are named for the direction from which the wind is blowing , these winds are called the northeasterly trade winds in the Northern Hemisphere and the southeasterly trade winds in the Southern Hemisphere . The trade winds of both hemispheres meet at the doldrums . </P> <P> As they blow across tropical regions , air masses heat up over lower latitudes due to more direct sunlight . Those that develop over land ( continental ) are drier and hotter than those that develop over oceans ( maritime ) , and travel northward on the western periphery of the subtropical ridge . Maritime tropical air masses are sometimes referred to as trade air masses . The one region of the Earth which has an absence of trade winds is the north Indian ocean . </P> <H2> Weather effects ( edit ) </H2> <P> Clouds which form above regions within trade wind regimes are typically composed of cumulus which extend no more than 4 kilometres ( 13,000 ft ) in height , and are capped from being taller by the trade wind inversion . Trade winds originate more from the direction of the poles ( northeast in the Northern Hemisphere , southeast in the Southern Hemisphere ) during the cold season , and are stronger in the winter than the summer . As an example , the windy season in the Guianas , which lie at low latitudes in South America , occurs between January and April . When the phase of the Arctic oscillation ( AO ) is warm , trade winds are stronger within the tropics . The cold phase of the AO leads to weaker trade winds . When the trade winds are weaker , more extensive areas of rain fall upon landmasses within the tropics , such as Central America . </P> <P> During mid-summer in the Northern Hemisphere ( July ) , the westward - moving trade winds south of the northward - moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean sea into southeastern North America ( Florida and Gulf Coast ) . When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge travels over land , rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance which leads to an increase in red sunsets . Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates . Although the Southeast USA has some of the cleanest air in North America , much of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida . Since 1970 , dust outbreaks have worsened due to periods of drought in Africa . There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year . Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida , primarily since the 1970s . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Intertropical Convergence Zone </Li> <Li> Winds in the Age of Sail </Li> <Li> Westerly wind burst </Li> <Li> Volta do mar </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Carol G.

Troy Bolton is still dating Gabriella Montez , who decides to stay in Albuquerque with her mother . Troy eventually decides to look for a summer job to gain money for college . </P> <P> Sharpay and Ryan Evans plan to spend part of the summer at their family 's country club , Lava Springs ( `` Fabulous '' ) , but Sharpay 's summer plans also include pursuing Troy , whom she has arranged to be hired at the club . However , Troy convinces the club 's manager , Mr. Fulton , into hiring Gabriella and their close group of friends as well ; including Taylor and Chad . Sharpay is enraged upon learning that Gabriella is working as one of the lifeguards , but is unable to get her fired . So she orders Fulton to give them difficult tasks so they would be best to quit . Fulton attempts to intimidate the group , but Troy rebuilds their confidence and convinces them that they can persevere ( `` Work This Out '' ) . </P> <P> Troy continues to worry about funding for college . Sharpay senses his need and arranges for Troy to be promoted , hoping that this will convince him to sing with her at the talent show . Meanwhile , Kelsi writes a ballad for Troy and Gabriella . Troy agrees to sing with his friends in the show ( `` You Are The Music In Me '' ) , not knowing that Sharpay is vying for his attention . ( In the extended version , Sharpay and Ryan trap Troy as he prepares for a date with Gabriella , and perform their potential show - stopper ( `` Humuhumunukunukuapua'a '' ) . ) </P> <P> Ryan realizes he does not mean much to Sharpay anymore , as she is ready to blow her brother aside for the opportunity to perform with Troy . This leads to tension between the twin siblings and Ryan angrily informs Sharpay that he will no longer obey her orders . Taylor and Gabriella invite Ryan to the baseball game , where he persuades the Wildcats to take part in the talent show ( `` I Do n't Dance '' ) . </P> <P> Troy and Gabriella 's relationship is strained when Troy sees Ryan with Gabriella , sparking jealousy . Owing to a `` promise '' from Troy , he and Sharpay practice their song for the Midsummer Night 's Talent Show ( `` You Are The Music In Me ( Sharpay Version ) '' ) . </P> <P> When Sharpay discovers that Ryan and the Wildcats are putting together their own performance in the show , she orders Mr. Fulton to ban all junior staff members from performing . Gabriella angrily confronts Sharpay about her interference and quits her job at Lava Springs . Troy overhears the exchange and tries to persuade Gabriella to change her mind . Gabriella expresses her loss of trust with Troy ( `` Gotta Go My Own Way '' ) and leaves Lava Springs , and gives him the necklace back . It also seems that they broke up . </P> <P> Troy returns to work the next day to find that his friends refuse to talk to him . Kelsi silently shows Troy the notice from Mr. Fulton , causing Troy to question his own motivations ( `` Bet On It '' ) . He begins to reconcile with Chad and his other friends . Then Troy confronts Sharpay , informing her that he will not sing with her . The Wildcats and Chad forgive Troy for his absence and convince him to sing in the talent show , which he does only under the condition that they are all allowed to perform as well . </P> <P> At Sharpay 's supposed instruction , Ryan gives Troy a new song to learn moments before the show . As Troy goes onstage , he asks Sharpay why she switched the song , and Sharpay is shocked to find that her brother tricked her . Troy sings the song ( `` Everyday '' ) alone until Gabriella surprisingly joins him onstage . In the end , Sharpay proudly presents her brother , Ryan , with the award for the talent show . After the talent show , all the Wildcats go to the golf course to enjoy the fireworks . </P> <P> Everyone celebrates the end of the summer with a pool party ( `` All for One '' ) which features a cameo appearance by Miley Cyrus . </P> <H2> Cast </H2> Main article : List of High School Musical characters <Ul> <Li> Troy Bolton ( Zac Efron ) is Gabriella 's boyfriend , the most popular male student at East High School and the captain of the varsity basketball team .

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel ( who died in 1896 ) , awarded for outstanding contributions in physics . As dictated by Nobel 's will , the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10 , the anniversary of Nobel 's death .

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice -- in 1956 and 1972 . Maria Skłodowska - Curie also won two Nobel Prizes , for physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911 . William Lawrence Bragg was , until October 2014 , the youngest ever Nobel laureate ; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25 . Two women have won the prize : Curie and Maria Goeppert - Mayer ( 1963 ) . As of 2017 , the prize has been awarded to 206 individuals .

The 13th of Disney 's animated features , the film premiered in New York City and London on July 26 , 1951 . The film features the voices of Kathryn Beaumont as Alice , Sterling Holloway as the Cheshire Cat , Verna Felton as the Queen of Hearts , and Ed Wynn as the Mad Hatter . </P> <P> Walt Disney first attempted unsuccessfully to adapt Alice into an animated feature film during the 1930s . However , he finally revived the idea in the 1940s . The film was originally intended to be a live - action / animated film ; however , Disney decided to make it an all - animated feature in 1946 . The theme song of the same name has since become a jazz standard . While the film was critically panned on its initial release , the movie proved to be ahead of its time and has since been regarded as one of Disney 's greatest animated classics , notably one of the biggest cult classics in the animation medium , as well as one of the best film adaptations of Alice . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Plot </Li> <Li> 2 Cast </Li> <Li> 3 Directing animators </Li> <Li> 4 Production <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Development </Li> <Li> 4.2 Writing </Li> <Li> 4.3 Music </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Release and reception </Li> <Li> 6 Soundtrack <Ul> <Li> 6.1 Audio CD track listing </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 7 Media and merchandise <Ul> <Li> 7.1 Stage version </Li> <Li> 7.2 References in other Disney films </Li> <Li> 7.3 Theme parks </Li> <Li> 7.4 Video games </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Plot ( edit ) </H2> <P> On a riverbank , Alice spots a White Rabbit in a waistcoat passing by , exclaiming that he is `` late for a very important date '' . She gives chase , following him into a large rabbit hole . She sees him leave through a tiny door , whose talking knob advises her to shrink to an appropriate height by drinking from a bottle marked `` Drink Me '' . She does so and floats out through the keyhole in a sea of her own tears , which she cried after eating a biscuit marked `` Eat Me '' caused her to grow very large . As she continues to follow the Rabbit , she meets numerous characters , including Tweedledum and Tweedledee , who recount the tale of `` The Walrus and the Carpenter '' . </P> <P> Alice tracks the Rabbit to his house ; he sends her to retrieve his gloves after mistaking her for his housemaid . While searching for them , she eats another cookie marked `` Eat Me '' from his cookie canister and grows large again , getting stuck in the house . Thinking she is a monster , he brings the Dodo over to help him get rid of her . When the Dodo decides to burn the house down , Alice escapes by eating a carrot from the Rabbit 's garden , which causes her to shrink to three inches tall , and continues following him . Along the way , she meets a garden of talking flowers who initially welcome her with a song , but then mistake her for a weed and order her to leave , followed by a Caterpillar , who becomes enraged after she tells him she is distressed at her current height , as he is the same height , and turns into a butterfly . Before leaving , he advises her to eat a piece of his mushroom to alter her size . She does so and manages to return to her original height , and continues following the Rabbit . </P> <P> In the woods , Alice meets the Cheshire Cat , who advises her to visit the Mad Hatter or the March Hare to find out where the Rabbit is . She encounters both , along with the Dormouse , at the Hare 's house having a mad tea party and celebrating their `` unbirthday '' . They celebrate her unbirthday too , but she becomes frustrated at them interrupting her every time she tries to speak . As she is about to leave , the Rabbit appears , continuing to exclaim that he is late ; the Hatter examines his pocket watch and says it is `` two days slow '' , and attempts to `` fix '' it by filling it with food and tea but ends up having to destroy it after it goes `` mad '' . The Rabbit laments that his watch was an `` unbirthday present '' , and the Hatter and Hare sing `` The Unbirthday Song '' to him before throwing him back into the woods . Fed up with the nonsense , Alice decides to go home , but her surroundings have completely changed and she gets lost . Fearing she is lost forever , she sits on a rock sobbing . </P> <P> The Cheshire Cat reappears and advises Alice to ask the Queen of Hearts for directions home , showing her a `` shortcut '' to the King and tyrannical Queen 's castle . The Queen orders the beheading of a trio of playing card gardeners who mistakenly planted white roses instead of red ones , and invites ( or rather forces ) Alice to play against her in a croquet match , in which live flamingos , card guards and hedgehogs are used as equipment . The animals and card guards rig the game in favor of the Queen . The Cat appears again and plays a trick on the Queen , causing her to fall over . The Cat disappears in time to make it look like Alice was the prankster , but before the Queen can order her execution , the King suggests they have a trial . </P> <P> At Alice 's trial , the Mad Hatter , March Hare and Dormouse are called to the stand as witnesses , briefly celebrating the Queen 's unbirthday and giving her a headpiece as a present , which turns into the Cat . Chaos ensues when the frightened Dormouse runs around the courtroom . As the Queen orders Alice 's execution , Alice eats the pieces of the Caterpillar 's mushroom she saved and grows large again . The King and Queen order her to leave the courthouse , but she refuses and insults the Queen . As she does so , she returns to her normal size , and the Queen orders her execution . Alice flees , and the Queen , King , card guards and other characters give chase . When she reaches the small door she encountered at the beginning of the film , he shows her that she is actually already outside , asleep . She yells at herself to wake up ; she does and leaves the riverbank to go home for tea . </P> <H2> Cast ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Kathryn Beaumont as Alice </Li> <Li> Ed Wynn as Mad Hatter </Li> <Li> Jerry Colonna as March Hare </Li> <Li> Richard Haydn as Caterpillar </Li> <Li> Sterling Holloway as Cheshire Cat </Li> <Li> Verna Felton as Queen of Hearts </Li> <Li> J.

Like many children of the time he was familiar with the Alice books and had read them as a school boy . </P> <P> In 1923 , Disney was still a 21 - year - old filmmaker trying to make a name for himself by working at the Laugh - O - Gram Studio in Kansas City , making the unsuccessful short cartoon series by the name of Newman Laugh - O - Grams . The last of Newman Laugh - O - Grams was called Alice 's Wonderland , which was loosely inspired by the Alice books . The short featured a live - action girl ( Virginia Davis ) interacting in an animated world . Faced with business problems , however , the Laugh - O - Gram Studio went bankrupt in July 1923 , and the film was never released to the general public . However , Disney left for Hollywood and used the film as a sort of pilot to show to potential distributors . Margaret J. Winkler of Winkler Pictures agreed to distribute the Alice Comedies , and Disney partnered with his older brother Roy O. Disney and re-hired Kansas City co-workers including Ub Iwerks , Rudolph Ising , Friz Freleng , Carman Maxwell and Hugh Harman to form Disney Bros. Studios ( later Walt Disney Productions ) . The series began in 1924 before being retired in 1927 . </P> <P> In 1932 , Disney began playing with the idea of making an animated feature film and repeatedly turned to the idea of making a feature - length animated / live - action version of Alice starring Mary Pickford , and even purchased the rights to Sir John Tenniel 's illustrations ( still under copyright at the time ) . However , these plans were eventually scrapped in favor of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , mainly because Disney was put off by Paramount 's 1933 live - action adaptation . However , Disney did not completely abandon the idea of adapting Alice , and in 1936 made the Mickey Mouse cartoon Thru the Mirror . </P> <P> In 1938 , after the enormous success of Snow White , Disney revived the idea of making an Alice feature and officially registered the title Alice in Wonderland with the Motion Picture Association of America and hired storyboard artist Al Perkins and art director David S. Hall to develop the story and concept art for the film . A storyreel was complete in 1939 , but Walt was not pleased as he felt that Hall 's drawings resembled Tenniel 's drawings too closely making them too difficult to animate and that the overall tone of Perkins ' script was too grotesque and dark . Realising the amount of work needed for Alice in Wonderland , as well as the economic devastation of the World War II and the production demands of Pinocchio , Fantasia , and Bambi , Walt shelved production on Alice in Wonderland shortly after the screening . </P> <P> In 1945 , shortly after the war ended , Disney once again revived Alice in Wonderland and assigned British author Aldous Huxley to re-write the script . However , Walt felt that Huxley 's version was too much of a literal adaptation of Carroll 's book . Background artist Mary Blair submitted some concept drawings for Alice in Wonderland . Blair 's paintings moved away from Tenniel 's sketchy illustrations by taking a modernist stance , using bold and unreal colors . Walt liked Blair 's designs , and the script was re-written to focus on comedy , music , and the whimsical side to Carroll 's book . </P> <P> Disney toyed with the idea of having a live - action / animated version of Alice in Wonderland ( in a similar fashion to his Alice Comedies ) that would star Ginger Rogers and would utilize the recently developed sodium vapor process . Lisa Davis Waltz ( who would later voice Anita Radcliffe in One Hundred and One Dalmatians ) and Luana Patten were also considered for the role of Alice . However , Walt soon realized that he could only do justice to the book by making an all - animated feature , and in 1946 , work began on an all - animated version of Alice in Wonderland . </P> <H3> Writing ( edit ) </H3> <P> Through various drafts of the script , many sequences that were present in Caroll 's book drifted in and out of the story . However , Walt insisted that the scenes themselves keep close to those in the novel since most of its humor is in the writing . </P> <P> One omitted scene from the 1939 treatment of the film occurred outside the Duchess ' manor , where The Fish Footman is giving a message to The Frog Footman to take to the Duchess saying that she is invited to play croquet with The Queen of Hearts . Alice overhears this and sneaks into the kitchen of the manor , where she finds the Duchess ' Cook maniacally cooking and the Duchess nursing her baby . The cook is spraying pepper all over the room causing the Duchess and Alice to sneeze and the Baby to cry . After a quick conversation between Alice and the Duchess , the quick - tempered Cook starts throwing pots and pans at the noisy baby . Alice rescues the baby , but as she leaves the house the baby turns into a pig and runs away . The scene was scrapped for pacing reasons . </P> <P> Another scene that was deleted from a later draft occurred in Tulgey Wood , where Alice encountered what appeared to be a sinister - looking Jabberwock hiding in the dark , before revealing himself as a comical looking dragon - like beast with bells and factory whistles on his head . A song , `` Beware the Jabberwock '' , was also written . However , the scene was scrapped in favor of The Walrus and the Carpenter poem . Out of a desire to keep the Jabberwocky poem in the film , it was made to replace an original song for the Cheshire Cat , `` I 'm Odd '' . </P> <P> Another deleted scene in Tulgey Wood shows Alice consulting with The White Knight , who was meant to be somewhat of a caricature of Walt Disney . Although Walt liked the scene , he felt it was better if Alice learned her lesson by herself , hence the song `` Very Good Advice '' . </P> <P> Other characters , such as The Mock Turtle and the Gryphon were discarded for pacing reasons . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> <P> In an effort to retain some of Carroll 's imaginative verses and poems , Disney commissioned top songwriters to compose songs built around them for use in the film . A record number of potential songs were written for the film , based on Carroll 's verses -- over 30 -- and many of them found a way into the film , if only for a few brief moments . Alice in Wonderland would boast the greatest number of songs included in any Disney film , but because some of them last for mere seconds ( like `` How Do You Do and Shake Hands '' , `` We 'll Smoke the Monster Out '' , `` ' Twas Brillig '' , `` The Caucus Race '' , and others ) , this fact is frequently overlooked . The original song that Alice was to sing in the beginning was titled `` Beyond the Laughing Sky '' . The song , like so many other dropped songs , was not used by the producers . However , the composition was kept and the lyrics were changed . It later became the title song for Peter Pan ( which was in production at the same time ) , `` The Second Star to the Right '' . </P> <P> The title song , composed by Sammy Fain , has become a jazz standard , first adopted by jazz pianist Dave Brubeck ; featured first in 1952 , then on his 1957 Columbia album Dave Digs Disney . </P> <P> Izumi Yukimura sang her own theme song for the Japanese release of the film . </P> <P> The song , `` In a World of My Own , '' is included on the orange disc of Classic Disney : 60 Years of Musical Magic . </P> <H2> Release and reception ( edit ) </H2> <P> At the time , these creative decisions were met with great criticism from Carroll fans , as well as from British film and literary critics who accused Disney of `` Americanizing '' a great work of English literature . Disney was not surprised by the critical reception to Alice in Wonderland -- his version of Alice was intended for large family audiences , not literary critics -- but despite all the long years of thought and effort , the film met with a lukewarm response at the box office and was a sharp disappointment in its initial release , earning an estimated $2.4 million at the US box office in 1951 . </P> <P> Though not an outright disaster , the film was never re-released theatrically in Disney 's lifetime , airing instead every so often on network television . In fact , Alice in Wonderland aired as the second episode of Walt Disney 's Disneyland TV series on ABC in 1954 , in a severely edited version cut down to less than an hour . In The Disney Films , Leonard Maltin relates animator Ward Kimball felt the film failed because `` it suffered from too many cooks -- directors . Here was a case of five directors each trying to top the other guy and make his sequence the biggest and craziest in the show . This had a self - canceling effect on the final product . '' Walt Disney himself felt that the film failed because there was no `` warmth '' in Alice 's character . </P> <P> Almost two decades after its original release , after the North American success of George Dunning 's animated film Yellow Submarine ( 1968 ) , Disney 's version of Alice in Wonderland suddenly found itself in vogue with the times . In fact , because of Mary Blair 's art direction and the long - standing association of Carroll 's Alice in Wonderland with the drug culture , the feature was re-discovered as something of a `` head film '' ( along with Fantasia and The Three Caballeros ) among the college - aged and was shown in various college towns across the country . Disney resisted this association , and even withdrew prints of the film from universities , but then , in 1974 , Disney gave Alice in Wonderland its first theatrical re-release ever , and the company even promoted it as a film in tune with the `` psychedelic '' times ( mostly from the hit song `` White Rabbit '' performed by Jefferson Airplane ) . This re-release was so successful it warranted a subsequent re-release in 1981 . Its first UK re-release was on July 26 , 1979 . </P> <P> Later , with the advent of the home video market , Disney chose to make Alice in Wonderland one of the first titles available for the rental market on VHS and Beta and for retail sale on RCA 's short - lived CED Videodisc format . The film was released on October 15 , 1981 on VHS , CED Videodisc , and Betamax and May 28 , 1986 on VHS , Betamax , and Laserdisc in the Walt Disney Classics , ( though it was mastered for tape in 1985 ) , staying in general release ever since , with a 40th Anniversary video release in 1991 ( this and the 1986 video release were in Disney 's Classics Collection ) , followed by an October 28 , 1994 October 14 , 1997 VHS and Laserdisc release as a part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection. VHS and Laserdisc release as a part of the Walt Disney Masterpiece Collection . It was released on Region 1 DVD on July 4 , 2000 ( under the Gold Classic Collection DVD series ) . A fully restored two - disc `` Masterpiece Edition '' was released on January 27 , 2004 , including the full hour - long episode of the Disney television show with Kathryn Beaumont , Edgar Bergen , Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd , Bobby Driscoll and others that promoted the film , computer games , deleted scenes , songs and related materials , which went back on moratorium in January 2009 . Disney released a 2 - disc special `` Un-Anniversary '' edition DVD on March 30 , 2010 in order to promote the then - new Tim Burton film . The movie was released in a Blu - ray / DVD combo on February 1 , 2011 to celebrate its 60th anniversary featuring a new HD restoration of the movie and many released bonus features . Disney re-released the film on Blu - ray and DVD on April 26 , 2016 to celebrate the film 's 65th anniversary . </P> <P> On the film aggregator website , Rotten Tomatoes , the overall rating of the film is a `` fresh '' 79 % from 28 critical reviews with an average rating of 6.4 / 10 . Its consensus states that `` A good introduction to Lewis Carroll 's classic , Alice in Wonderland boasts some of the Disney canon 's most surreal and twisted images .

He forms the X-Force , a team of mutants . </Li> <Li> Josh Brolin as Nathan Summers / Cable : A time travelling cybernetic mutant soldier , `` in many ways the opposite of Deadpool '' . Director David Leitch called the dynamic between Cable and Deadpool `` sort of classic buddy - cop fare '' , and compared them to the characters portrayed by Nick Nolte and Eddie Murphy , respectively , in 48 Hrs. ( 1982 ) . Brolin signed a four - film deal to play the character , and described his appearance here as just the introduction for the character , with `` three more movies to reveal more . '' </Li> <Li> Morena Baccarin as Vanessa : An escort and Wilson 's fiancée . </Li> <Li> Julian Dennison as Russell : A young mutant being hunted by Cable . Dennison was the only actor that the creative team considered for the role , with Russell `` sort of a tailor - made character '' for the actor . </Li> <Li> Zazie Beetz as Neena Thurman / Domino : A mercenary with the mutant ability to manipulate luck , who joins Deadpool 's X-Force team . Leitch described the film 's version of the character as Beetz ' own `` real fun interesting take '' . Beetz began `` doing strength conditioning , so that 's like working out everyday '' when she got the role , for which she has to `` be shooting guns , I fight and a lot of that movement is full body and physical . '' </Li> <Li> T.J. Miller as Weasel : Wilson 's best friend , the owner of a bar frequented by mercenaries . </Li> <Li> Brianna Hildebrand as Negasonic Teenage Warhead : A teenage X-Man with the mutant power to detonate atomic bursts from her body , she is now a `` new level of X-Men '' after being a trainee in the first film . Hildebrand felt that `` it 's cool that she 's grown and matured and she still has so much of this essence of a punk kid '' from the first film , and added that the character would have a `` cooler '' costume in the sequel . </Li> <Li> Jack Kesy as Black Tom Cassidy : A mutant who can manipulate energy through plants . </Li> <Li> Stefan Kapičić as the voice of Colossus : An X-Man with the mutant ability to transform his entire body into organic steel . Kapičić described Colossus as one of the most important characters in the film , requiring a more intense process for Kapičić during recording for the character . He explained that Colossus would continue to try make Deadpool a better person and potential X-Man after doing so in the first film . </Li> </Ul> <P> Leslie Uggams and Karan Soni return from the first film as Deadpool 's elderly roommate Blind Al and the taxi driver Dopinder , respectively . The X-Force team also includes Terry Crews as Bedlam , Lewis Tan as Shatterstar , and Rob Delaney as Peter . Shioli Kutsuna , Eddie Marsan , and Bill Skarsgård have been cast in undisclosed roles . </P> <H2> Production </H2> <H3> Development </H3> <P> Producer Simon Kinberg revealed in September 2015 that discussions had begun regarding ideas for a sequel to Deadpool , which was set to be released in February 2016 . One idea was for the film to introduce the character Cable , who had previously been looked at to appear in the first Deadpool , and X-Men : Days of Future Past before that . Cable 's inclusion in the potential sequel was confirmed by the character Deadpool , breaking the fourth wall , in the post-credit scene of the first film . Domino , a character with connections to Cable in the comics , was also believed to be featured in the sequel . By the first film 's release , 20th Century Fox had green - lit a sequel , with writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick returning to write the screenplay . Though director Tim Miller and producer / star Ryan Reynolds were not confirmed for the sequel at the time , Fox was `` intent on keeping the creative team together '' . Miller and Reynolds ' involvement was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon that April , though Miller had still not formally signed on to direct the sequel yet . He began work developing the script with the writers , while Reynolds had signed a new contract granting him `` casting approval and other creative controls '' . </P> It has to tonally and stylistically be as fresh and original ( as the first film ) . That 's a big challenge especially because they had 10 years to gestate on the first movie and we do n't have that kind of time on the second movie . That 's the biggest mandate going ( into ) the second film ... we have to resist the temptation to make it bigger . <P> -- Producer Simon Kinberg on approaching Deadpool 2 </P> <P> In June 2016 , Kinberg said that a completed draft from Wernick and Rheese was expected `` soon '' , and that they were looking to begin filming the sequel at the beginning of 2017 . By August , Kyle Chandler was believed to be in the running to portray Cable . Testing of actresses for Domino had also begun by October , with the shortlist of actresses under consideration including Lizzy Caplan , Mary Elizabeth Winstead , Sienna Miller , Sofia Boutella , Stephanie Sigman , Sylvia Hoeks , Mackenzie Davis , Ruby Rose , Eve Hewson , and Kelly Rohrbach . The producers were particularly interested in casting a black or Latina actress in the role . </P> <P> At the end of October , Miller left the film over `` mutual creative differences '' with Reynolds . The rift between the pair was reportedly based on several factors , including Reynolds ' expanded creative control over the sequel ; Miller 's wish for a more stylized follow - up than the first film , versus Reynolds ' focus `` on the raunchy comedy style that earned the first movie its R rating '' ; and Miller 's intention to cast Chandler as Cable , which Reynolds opposed . Fox ultimately backed `` its marketable star '' over Miller , who had made his directorial debut with the first film . Miller denied these reported reasons , while Reynolds said , `` All I can really add is that I 'm sad to see him off the film . Tim 's brilliant and nobody worked harder on Deadpool than he did . '' A week after Miller 's departure , Fox was looking at David Leitch , Drew Goddard , Magnus Martens , and Rupert Sanders as potential replacements for the director . Leitch was the `` strong frontrunner '' for the role , and signed on to direct a month later . Reynolds , a fan of Leitch 's John Wick , said the director `` really understands those Deadpool sensibilities and where we need to take the franchise from here . '' He added that Leitch `` can make a movie on an ultra tight minimal budget look like it was shot for 10 -- 15 times what it cost . '' </P> <H3> Pre-production </H3> <P> Reese and Wernick had completed multiple drafts of the script by January 2017 , saying , `` It 's taken different twists and turns , but it 's really coalescing '' ; the film was still on track to begin filming that year . The pair felt a responsibility to explore the team X-Force , which includes Deadpool , Cable , and Domino in the comics , with Reese saying the sequel 's purpose `` is not to set up X-Force ( but ) it will likely set up X-Force . '' He did clarify that though the film will be `` populated with a lot of characters ... it is still Deadpool 's movie '' . The pair confirmed that Stefan Kapičić 's Colossus , Brianna Hildebrand 's Negasonic Teenage Warhead , and Karan Soni 's Dopinder would be returning from the first film to `` make at least an appearance '' , and that the film would not be exploring the details of Cable 's convoluted comic origins . By the next month , it had been noted that there had been few announcements from Fox regarding the film , and that a release date had not yet been set which was seen as unusual for sequels to popular films ( often studios `` announce sequels far too soon and with no idea what will happen '' ) , with the issue deemed to be the film 's script . Reynolds , Reese , and Wernick had been `` bunkered down , working on the script together , trying to cross the finish line and create something everyone is excited to make '' . At that time , Goddard joined the project to consult on the script . </P> <P> By the beginning of March 2017 , Michael Shannon had been in the running to portray Cable , but no longer could due to a scheduling conflict . David Harbour had screen - tested for the role , and Pierce Brosnan was believed to be in negotiations for a part in the film , potentially Cable . Reynolds announced shortly after that Zazie Beetz had been cast as Domino . Later in the month , Shannon was in the running to portray Cable again , and was considered the frontrunner , with Fox also looking at a shortlist of other actors that included Harbour . Brad Pitt had also been considered for the role , and expressed interest in taking it , but had `` moved on '' . Leitch soon addressed the potential casting of these actors , saying Shannon `` would make an incredible Cable ... If that happens , I would be through the roof '' ; and on Pitt , `` We had a great meeting with Brad , he was incredibly interested in the property . Things did n't work out schedule-wise . He 's a fan , and we love him , and I think he would 've made an amazing Cable . '' At the end of March , Morena Baccarin confirmed her return from the first film as Vanessa , and expressed interest in exploring the character 's Copycat persona from the comics in the sequel . Josh Brolin emerged as a `` surprise contender '' to play Cable in April , ahead of Shannon and Harbour , and was officially cast in the role . Brolin also portrays the Marvel Comics character Thanos , in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . Leslie Uggams confirmed that she would be reprising her role of Blind Al from the first film , while Fox gave the sequel a June 1 , 2018 release date . </P> <P> Noting the release date , Leitch wanted to ensure that the film `` was worthy of a summer tentpole movie , and we knew we were going to be wedged in between some big films '' , specifically wanting to expand the action and make the general feeling of the film `` bigger '' than the first one . However , he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original `` in terms of the tone , and the fun ... I love that challenge '' of combining that with the increased scope . The film uses Deadpool 's fourth wall - breaking to reference this release period , with Leitch calling these comments `` definitely fresh and timely when they come up . '' In May 2017 , Fox was reportedly looking to use a post-credits scene at the end of Deadpool 2 to introduce several other members of X-Force who would go on to star alongside Reynolds , Brolin , and Beetz in an X-Force film . Casting for the characters -- Sunspot , Feral , and Shatterstar -- would take place over the coming months , though Reese denied the accuracy of this report . Later , T.J. Miller confirmed that he would return from the first film as Weasel , and described the sequel as `` even more weaselicious '' than the first . He noted that Reynolds and the writers had `` really put the time in on the script '' to meet their own expectations for the sequel as well as those of fans . Jack Kesy also joined the cast , as Black Tom Cassidy . In June , Shioli Kutsuna was cast in a key role for the film . </P> <H3> Filming </H3> <P> Initial filming had begun by June 17 , 2017 , at Hatley Castle in Victoria , Canada , which is used to portray the X-Mansion in the X-Men films . Principal photography began in Vancouver on June 26 , under the working title Love Machine . Jonathan Sela served as cinematographer for the film . At the end of June , Reynolds revealed that Julian Dennison had been cast in the film . The next month , T.J. Miller said that he found the sequel to be funnier than the first film , and that `` it 's not going to be the same movie in a different location ( like The Hangover Part II ) . It 's got different stakes , different things happen , some pretty tragic , dark shit happens in the first part of the film , in the beginning , and the rest of the film is kind of dealing with that . '' By then , Kapičić had been working with Leitch on the set , and expected to continue contributing to Colossus through to April 2018 . </P> <P> On August 14 , stunt woman Joi `` SJ '' Harris died in a motorcycle accident after losing control and crashing into Shaw Tower . Harris , the first African - American female professional road racer , was working on the film as a stunt performer for the first time and had only joined the production a week before . Harris was not wearing a helmet because the character she was portraying , Domino , does not wear one in the scene , and there had not been time since she joined the film to create one for her to fit underneath the Domino wig . She had two full days of rehearsing the stunt as well as five more attempts on the day of the accident . Veteran stunt double Melissa Stubbs had been available and willing to do the stunt , but the inexperienced Harris was preferred due to her skin color being a match for Beetz . This decision was criticized by multiple stunt professionals , with many noting that Harris ' experiences racing motorcycles did not necessarily qualify her as an able stunt performer . Production on the film was shut down immediately after the incident , but resumed two days later . With this news also came reports that the film 's crew were `` enduring very long hours '' and were `` exhausted by the schedule '' , with a member of the studio confirming that some days had gone beyond the scheduled 12 -- 13 hours filming , up to 15 -- plus hours . </P> <P> Earlier in August , Reynolds revealed that Rob Delaney was at the film 's set , and Eddie Marsan revealed that he was also on set for a role in the film later in the month . Filming in Vancouver was expected to last until October 6 , with production on Deadpool 2 being officially completed on October 14 . Discussing the film 's action , having previously worked as a stunt coordinator , Leitch said that all stunts are `` variations on a theme '' with the same basic elements , but Deadpool allows you to `` subvert those basics , and there 's an expectation for a classic gag , but oops , maybe you get something else . '' He also felt that introducing Domino gave the film unique opportunities for action sequences taking advantage of her luck - based abilities , as well as focusing on Deadpool 's healing abilities and trying to use those to create interesting action . </P> <H3> Post-production </H3> <P> Fox revealed in November that the film was technically untitled at that point , and not officially known as Deadpool 2 as had been assumed ; the studio was temporarily referring to the film as The Untitled Deadpool Sequel . In January 2018 , the film 's release was moved up to May 18 , 2018 . A month later , Terry Crews was revealed to have a role in the film , the character Shatterstar was confirmed to be appearing , and the production returned to Vancouver for six days of reshoots under a new working title , Daisy . </P> <P> While some reports emerged by mid-March claiming that the reshoots were due to poor audience responses during test screenings of the film , and consisted of sweeping changes , the film was soon confirmed to be testing better than the original did , up to 98 out of 100 over three different tests ( compared to a maximum score of 91 during tests of the first film ) . Because of this , the reshoots were adding more of the elements that audiences responded positively to , including additional material featuring Cable and Domino . By the end of the month , two hours - worth of filming had taken place in Los Angeles for a then - secret cameo appearance , and the film 's first full trailer was released . Officially titling the film Deadpool 2 , the trailer also revealed that Crews was portraying Bedlam ; that Delaney was in the film , portraying Peter ; and that Bill Skarsgård also had a role . The film 's final trailer , released a month later , confirmed that Lewis Tan would portray Shatterstar , joining Domino , Bedlam , and Peter as members of the X-Force in the film . </P> <H2> Music </H2> <P> Deadpool composer Junkie XL chose not to return for the sequel due to Miller 's departure . In October 2017 , Tyler Bates was hired to write the score for the film . </P> <H2> Release </H2> <P> Deadpool 2 is set to be released in the United States on May 18 , 2018 . It was previously scheduled for release on June 1 of that year . </P> <H3> Marketing </H3> <P> For the Fox presentation at CineEurope 2017 in June , Reynolds made a video message featuring himself in costume as Deadpool from the film 's set . The first teaser poster , which pays homage to Norman Rockwell 's 1943 painting Freedom from Want , was released that November . Justin Carter of Comic Book Resources found it `` oddly appropriate for Deadpool 2 to co-opt ( this ) iconic work for a modern pop culture audience '' as it is `` true to Deadpool 's incredibly referential nature . '' Eric Diaz of Nerdist said , `` It strikes exactly the irreverent tone you 'd expect for the Deadpool sequel . '' The first footage from the film debuted the following week , at the end of a video where Reynolds ( in - character as Deadpool ) parodies Bob Ross and his television show The Joy of Painting . The video was described by The Hollywood Reporter 's Ryan Parker as `` completely out of left field '' and setting the tone perfectly for the film , though his colleague Graeme McMillan was less positive due to not knowing of Ross ( Deadpool co-creator Fabian Nicieza thought the fact that many in the audience would n't know of Ross made the video `` exactly the kind of quirky pop culture choice that works perfectly for Deadpool '' ) . Parker added , `` This trailer only showed a few seconds from the film , but fans will be talking about it all day '' because of the presentation , unlike `` any other trailer which would have shown so little of the product . '' </P> <P> Rather than pay for an expensive advertisement spot during Super Bowl LII , the film 's official Twitter account was used to `` live tweet '' the event with commentary as if the character Deadpool was watching it . A new trailer for the film was released later that week , focusing on introducing Cable . Parker felt that `` Reynolds and company have completely changed the trailer game . The formula of just showing some of the actual movie , but with a tiny story thrown in is such an incredible marketing idea . '' McMillan and their colleague Aaron Couch praised the trailer playing on the visual effects for Cable 's arm not being finished , noting it as a joke about the visual effects to remove Henry Cavill 's mustache from Justice League . The group collectively praised the overall marketing for the franchise , with McMillan suggesting that the campaign for the sequel may surpass that of the first Deadpool . A full trailer for the film , explaining its general plot , was released at the end of March . Forbes contributor Scott Mendelson called it `` pretty funny and mostly entertaining '' , but was disappointed in it being a `` conventional '' trailer compared to the more out - there videos previously released for the film . He explained that he thought the first film `` had a winning lead character and fine character - centric jokes , but a pretty generic origin story plot that eventually became the thing it was critiquing '' , and was concerned that the sequel would turn out to be `` a more standard ' superhero sequel ' sell '' . Mendelson also noted the inclusion of T.J. Miller in the trailer following the reveal of sexual misconduct allegations against the actor in late 2017 , calling it `` inevitable no matter how tarnished his reputation might be these days . '' The Hollywood Reporter group also noted the more traditional style of the trailer , but remained generally positive about the film and highlighted the supporting cast for the film as appearing in the trailer , including Brolin , Beetz , Kutsuna , and Crews . </P> <P> Also in March , a Twitter account was established for the character Peter and began to be regularly updated with `` tweets '' about his interests , including photos of the character beekeeping and preparing for his work as part of the X-Force team ( as seen in the film ) . A month later , Fox released the final trailer for the film , with Mendelson lamenting that it was as `` conventional '' as the previous trailer but finding it understandable that Fox not be seen to be hiding the film , and ultimately felt that the trailer indicated the film would be `` a pretty solid comic book sequel '' . The group at The Hollywood Reporter praised the final trailer as well , highlighting its references to X-Men Origins : Wolverine and the DC universe as well as its introduction of Peter . At the end of April , Leitch stated that alternate versions of jokes that had been cut from the film were included in the trailers , since `` only one can live in the movie , so we might have snuck a couple in sort of additional materials that people can discover . '' As part of a promotion for the film with beverage company Mike 's Harder , Sister Margaret 's School for Wayward Girls -- the fictional bar featured in the films -- will be emulated in pop - ups at the Alligator Lounge in New York from April 26 -- 28 and the Slipper Clutch in Los Angeles from May 10 -- 12 . The pop - ups will respectively serve pizza and chimichangas , traditionally Deadpool 's favorite food , as well as Deadpool - inspired Harder drinks . The campaign also includes the chance to win a trip to the film 's premiere through Harder , and the Los Angeles pop - up will benefit the nonprofit DTLA Film Festival . </P> <H2> Box office projection </H2> <P> Initial box office projections for the film in March 2018 expected it to gross $100 million over its opening weekend in the United States and Canada , with a final domestic total expected to be lower than that of the first film ( $363 million ) at around $242 million . On April 20 , 2018 , both Fandango and Regal Cinemas announced that Deadpool 2 was the best pre-selling R - rated film in their respective histories . By April 26 , opening weekend industry projections had reached upwards of $150 million . </P> <H2> Sequel </H2> <P> By November 2016 , with development underway on Deadpool 2 , Fox was also planning Deadpool 3 , which was said to include the team X-Force . With the confirmation that Leitch would direct Deadpool 2 , it was revealed that Fox was looking for a separate filmmaker to direct Deadpool 3 . In March 2017 , Reese clarified that though Deadpool 2 sets - up the X-Force team , a future film focused on the team would be separate from Deadpool 3 , `` so I think we 'll be able to take two paths . ( X-Force ) is where we 're launching something bigger , but then ( Deadpool 3 is ) where we 're contracting and staying personal and small . '' After the proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney was announced in December 2017 , Disney CEO Bob Iger said that Deadpool would be integrated with the Marvel Cinematic Universe under Disney , and that the company would be willing to make future R - rated Deadpool films `` as long as we let the audiences know what 's coming '' . </P> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Anderton , Ethan ( March 22 , 2018 ) . `` ' Deadpool 2 ' Trailer Breakdown : What the F * cksicle Is This ?

It overlooks the Ronne Ice Shelf near the base of the Antarctic Peninsula . The massif is located about 1,200 kilometres ( 750 mi ) from the South Pole . Vinson Massif was discovered in January 1958 by U.S. Navy aircraft . In 1961 , the Vinson Massif was named by the Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names ( US - ACAN ) , for Carl G. Vinson , United States congressman from the state of Georgia , for his support for Antarctic exploration . On Nov. 1 , 2006 , US - ACAN declared Mount Vinson and Vinson Massif to be separate entities . </P> <P> Mount Vinson is the highest peak in Antarctica , at 4,892 metres ( 16,050 ft ) . It lies in the north part of Vinson Massif 's summit plateau in the south portion of the main ridge of the Sentinel Range about 2 kilometres ( 1.2 mi ) north of Hollister Peak . It was first climbed in 1966 by an American team led by Nicholas Clinch . An expedition in 2001 was the first to climb via the Eastern route , and also took GPS measurements of the height of the peak . As of February 2010 , 1,400 climbers have attempted to reach the top of Mount Vinson . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Geography </Li> <Li> 2 Climate and glaciers </Li> <Li> 3 History <Ul> <Li> 3.1 First ascent </Li> <Li> 3.2 Later ascents </Li> <Li> 3.3 First ascent from east side </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Maps </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Geography ( edit ) </H2> <P> The Vinson Massif extends between Goodge Col and Branscomb Glacier to the northwest , Nimitz Glacier and Gildea Glacier to the southwest and south , and Dater Glacier and its tributary Hinkley Glacier to the east . The southeastern part of the massif ends at Hammer Col , which joins it to the Craddock Massif , of which the highest point is Mount Rutford ( 4,477 metres ( 14,688 ft ) ) . The massif comprises both the high central Vinson Plateau with its few peaks rising to over 4,700 metres ( 15,400 ft ) , and several side ridges mostly trending southwest or northeast from the plateau . </P> <P> The current height ( 4,892 metres ( 16,050 ft ) ) of Mount Vinson was measured by a GPS survey that was conducted by the 2004 Omega Foundation team comprising Damien Gildea of Australia ( leader ) and Rodrigo Fica and Camilo Rada of Chile . Since 1998 and continuing through 2007 , the Omega Foundation has placed a GPS receiver on the summit for a suitable period of time to obtain accurate satellite readings . </P> <H2> Climate and glaciers ( edit ) </H2> <P> The climate on Mount Vinson is generally controlled by the polar ice cap 's high - pressure system , creating predominantly stable conditions but , as in any polar climate , high winds and snowfall are a possibility . Though the annual snowfall on Mount Vinson is low , high winds can cause base camp accumulations up to 46 centimetres ( 18 in ) in a year . During the summer season , November through January , there are 24 hours of sunlight . While the average temperature during these months is − 30 ° C ( − 20 ° F ) , the intense sun will melt snow on dark objects . </P> <P> Over successive years , the limited amount of snow that falls on Vinson Massif compacts and is transformed into ice , forming glaciers . These glaciers follow the topography and flow down the mountain 's valleys . The uppermost glacier occupies Jacobsen Valley on the north face of Mount Vinson , and flows either into Branscomb Glacier to the west or Crosswell Glacier to the east . The Crosswell Glacier flows into the Rutford Ice Stream via Ellen Glacier . The south face of Mount Vinson is drained by Roché Glacier , which flows westwards into Branscomb Glacier , with the latter leaving Vinson Massif to join Nimitz Glacier . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> A high mountain , provisionally known as ' Vinson ' , was long suspected to be in this part of West Antarctica , but it was not actually seen until January 1958 , when it was spotted by US Navy aircraft from Byrd Station . It was named after Carl Vinson , United States Representative from Georgia who was a key supporter of funding for Antarctic research . The first measurement of the Vinson Massif was established in 1959 at the elevation of 5,140 m ( 16,864 ft ) . </P> <H3> First ascent ( edit ) </H3> <P> In 1963 , two groups within the American Alpine Club , one led by Charles D. Hollister and Samuel C. Silverstein , M.D. , then in New York , and the other led by Peter Schoening of Seattle , Washington , began lobbying the National Science Foundation to support an expedition to climb Mount Vinson . The two groups merged in spring 1966 at the urging of the National Science Foundation and the American Alpine Club , and Nicholas Clinch was recruited by the American Alpine Club to lead the merged expeditions . Officially named the American Antarctic Mountaineering Expedition 1966 / 67 , the expedition was sponsored by the American Alpine Club and the National Geographic Society , and supported in the field by the U.S. Navy and the National Science Foundation Office of Antarctic Programs . Ten scientists and mountaineers participated in AAME 1966 / 67 . In addition to Clinch they were Barry Corbet , John Evans ( University of Minnesota , Minneapolis , MN ) , Eiichi Fukushima ( University of Washington , Seattle , WA ) , Charles Hollister , Ph. D. ( Columbia University , New York , NY ) , William Long , Ph. D. ( Alaska Methodist University , Anchorage , AK ) , Brian Marts , Peter Schoening , Samuel Silverstein , M.D. ( Rockefeller University , New York , NY ) and Richard Wahlstrom . </P> <P> In the months prior to its departure for Antarctica the expedition received considerable press attention , primarily because of the reports that Woodrow Wilson Sayre was planning to fly in a Piper Apache piloted by Max Conrad , the `` flying Grandfather '' , with four companions into the Sentinel Range to climb the Mount Vinson . Sayre had a reputation for problematic trips as a result of his unauthorized , unsuccessful , and nearly fatal attempt to climb Mount Everest from the North in 1962 . His unauthorized incursion into Tibet led China to file an official protest with the U.S. State Department . In the end , the purported race did not materialize as Conrad had difficulties with his plane . According to press reports , he and Sayre were still in Buenos Aires on the day the first four members of AAME 1966 / 67 reached Mount Vinson 's summit . </P> <P> In December 1966 the Navy transported the expedition and its supplies from Christchurch , New Zealand to the U.S. base at McMurdo Sound , Antarctica , and from there in a ski - equipped C - 130 Hercules to the Sentinel Range . All members of the expedition reached the summit of Mount Vinson . The first group of four climbers summited on December 18 , 1966 , four more on December 19 , and the last three on December 20 . </P> <P> On August 17 , 2006 , from nomination by Damien Gildea of the Omega Foundation , US - ACAN approved naming the subsidiary peaks south of Mount Vinson for the AAME 1966 / 67 members Nicholas Clinch , Barry Corbet , Eiichi Fukushima , Charles Hollister , Brian Marts , Samuel Silverstein , Peter Schoening and Richard Wahlstrom . Other peaks in the Sentinel Range had previously been named for John Evans and William Long . </P> <H3> Later ascents ( edit ) </H3> Gavin Bate ascending Mount Vinson in 2000 <P> The climb of Vinson offers little technical difficulty beyond the usual hazards of travel in Antarctica , and as one of the Seven Summits , it has received much attention from well - funded climbers in recent years . Multiple guide companies offer guided expeditions to Mount Vinson , at a typical cost of around $30,000 per person , including transportation to Antarctica from Chile . </P> <H3> First ascent from east side ( edit ) </H3> <P> While the vast majority of prior climbs to the summit have used the western side of the massif from the Branscomb Glacier , the first ascent from the east side was successfully completed by an eight - person team sponsored by NOVA in January 2001 . The team consisted of : </P> <Ul> <Li> Conrad Anker -- expedition leader </Li> <Li> Jon Krakauer -- mountaineer and author </Li> <Li> Dave Hahn -- mountain guide with 34 ascents , including ascents to Gardner , and Shinn . </Li> <Li> Andrew Mclean -- extreme skier </Li> <Li> Dan Stone -- glaciologist </Li> <Li> Lisel Clark -- producer </Li> <Li> John Armstrong -- cameraman </Li> <Li> Rob Raker -- assistant cameraman and sound recording </Li> </Ul> <P> The team not only made the first ascent from the east side but also performed scientific research into snow accumulation at different elevations as well as taking the first ground based GPS reading from the summit . The GPS reading gave the elevation of the highest point in Antarctica as 16,077 ft ( 4,900 m ) , eclipsing the earlier established heights recorded in 1959 and 1979 . </P> <P> Another first was the successful aircraft landing of a Twin Otter on the Upper Dater Glacier on the eastern slopes of Mount Vinson . </P> <P> NOVA named the production `` Mountain of Ice '' , which first aired on PBS in February 2003 . </P> <H2> Maps ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Vinson Massif .

When she and her lady - in - waiting , Cassandra , sneak out of the castle , they come upon some magical black rock spikes that magically bring back her long blonde hair ( which is now indestructable , so Rapunzel has to hide it from everyone , especially her parents ) . Eventually , Eugene , Maximus and Pascal find out about the hair as well , but Rapunzel decides not to tell Eugene about how she got her hair back ( because Cassandra does n't trust him ) , a decision which he hardly agrees with . Rapunzel manages to hide her hair from her parents , but becomes very nervous because of her coronation day . To complicate matters , a female rogue , Lady Caine , appears at Rapunzel 's coronation with a hatred of King Frederic who had taken away her father a long time ago . With no other choice , Rapunzel reveals her new 70 - feet long hair and , with her friends ' help , defeats the thugs . Later , that night , Rapunzel admits to her father that she had snuck out of the castle ( but does n't mention anything about Cassandra helping her ) , so King Fredric has no other choice , but to forbid Rapunzel from leaving the walls of Corona . Rapunzel feels trapped again ( just like in her old tower ) , but with her mother 's encouragement , she decides to take her relationship and role in Corona one day at a time . </P> A little while later , a mysterious individual comes across the site of the magical flower that cured Rapunzel 's mother and was the original source of her magical long blonde hair . We see now there is nothing left , but even more mysterious black rock spikes covering the area . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Season 1 ( 2017 -- 18 ) ( edit ) </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> No . overall </Th> <Th> No. in season </Th> <Th> Title </Th> <Th> Directed by </Th> <Th> Written by </Th> <Th> Original air date </Th> <Th> Prod . code </Th> <Th> U.S. viewers ( millions ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` What the Hair ! ?

The game was released as a paid - for early access title for Microsoft Windows , macOS , PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on July 25 , 2017 , with a full free - to - play release expected in 2018 . The retail versions of the game were published by Gearbox Publishing , while online distribution of the PC versions is handled by Epic 's launcher . </P> <P> Fortnite is set in contemporary Earth , where the sudden appearance of a worldwide storm causes 98 % of the world 's population to disappear , and zombie - like creatures rise to attack the remainder . Considered by Epic as a cross between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead , Fortnite has up to four players cooperating on various missions on randomly - generated maps to collect resources , build fortifications around defensive objectives that are meant to help fight the storm and protect survivors , and construct weapons and traps to engage in combat with waves of these creatures that attempt to destroy the objectives . Players gain rewards through these missions to improve their hero characters , support teams , and arsenal of weapon and trap schematics to be able to take on more difficult missions . The game is supported through microtransactions to purchase in - game currency that can be used towards these upgrades . </P> <P> A standalone mode , Fortnite Battle Royale , based on the battle royale game genre but based on the core Fortnite gameplay , was released for the same platforms in September 2017 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Synopsis </Li> <Li> 2 Gameplay </Li> <Li> 3 Development <Ul> <Li> 3.1 History </Li> <Li> 3.2 Art and design </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Reception <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Sales </Li> <Li> 4.2 Accolades </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Synopsis </H2> <P> One day , 98 % of Earth 's population suddenly disappeared , and the remaining population found the skies covered in dense clouds , creating chaotic storms that dropped husks , humanoid zombie - like creatures , that attacked the living . The survivors found ways to construct `` storm shields '' , a field that cleared the storm clouds from immediately overhead and reduced the attacks from husks , and used these to set up survivor bases across the globe . The player is a commander of one of these bases , charged with going out of the storm shield to find resources , survivors , and other allies to help expand their storm shield and find a way to return Earth to its normal state . </P> <H2> Gameplay </H2> <P> Currently , the paid - for product Fortnite provides two distinct modes : access to Fortnite Battle Royale , ( which is also available as a separate free - to - play title ) and the cooperative player - versus - environment `` Save the World '' , which is unique to the main Fortnite game . </P> <P> The `` Save the World '' mode is described as a co-op sandbox survival game and is about exploration , scavenging items , crafting weapons , building fortified structures , and fighting waves of encroaching monsters . Tim Sweeney , Epic 's founder , described the game as `` Minecraft meets Left 4 Dead '' . The game cycles between managing one 's resources at a safe home base , and then going out on missions to complete quests as to collect resources and obtain rewards to advance the game 's story . </P> <P> In the meta - game , the player has an inventory of weapon and trap schematics , hero characters , defender characters , and support characters , along with collected resources . Schematics are used to construct weapons and traps when on the field . Hero characters represent characters from one of four classes that the player can use while on a mission , as well as used to undertake resource - gathering missions making them unavailable to use until they return from the mission . Defender characters can be summoned to help with defense but only if there are less than four players on a mission . Support characters are used to form various non-playable squads that provide passive bonuses to the player 's attack strength , building speed , armor , and health , with additional benefits if the player can match certain characterization attributes within a squad . The player can spend different types of experience points and resources earned as mission rewards , from loot boxes ( represented as llama pinatas ) , or other sources to level up and evolve schematics and characters . For weapons and traps , this generally boosts their effectiveness as well as unlocking additional attribute bonuses , while leveling up hero characters will unlock special skills the character has while in the field . Schematics and characters are generally assigned a rarity , which determines how much they can be leveled and evolved . A player 's inventory of schematics and characters is limited , but players can opt to slot anyone they do not need into a collection book to gain rewards when certain collection sets are completed ; use one or more of these schematics or characters to transform them into a new random item , or simply retire them to gain back experience points and other resources to free up the inventory slots . </P> <P> The player also can spend skill points , earned by completing missions , and technology points , earned over time , to unlock new skills and technologies in the game 's skill and technologies trees . These can improve a player 's base attributes , attributes that are shared with the other players while on missions , unlock higher levels of evolution for schematics and characters , open up new squad positions , or unlock general skills that players can use in the field . Collectively , the player 's progress on these skill and technology trees , their squad composition , and their selected hero character make up the player 's current `` power level '' which relates to what difficulty of missions the player should take and the game 's matchmaking services . Also , players can review their current story progress and quests , which can include daily , side , and event quests , which when completed provide in - game currency or resources . </P> <P> Mission is currently divided between four world locations , some available only after progressing far enough in the story , and special locations for timed events and for the Survive the Storm mode . Within a location are several possible mission areas that show the type of mission , the terrain it takes place on , its difficulty rating relative to the player 's current power level , and whether the mission is currently under special `` storm '' conditions that throw random effects , like buffed husks or mini-bosses , into the mission but have potentially better rewards if completed . The player optionally can select a special site that automatically matches them with players at a similar power level and story progression on a random mission for added rewards . </P> <P> Most missions take place on procedurally - generated landscapes . Most missions are based on locating site ( s ) representing the objectives on the map , build up fortifications around those locations , and then face off against several waves of husks that will try to destroy the objectives . During completion of these missions , players are generally given a `` storm forecast '' to know where husks will spawn in as to enhance fortification in that direction , though this direction can change in more difficult missions . Other missions are time - limited , requiring the players to locate and help a number of survivors , build out several radar towers , or clear out various encampment of husks scattered around the map before time runs out . These missions encourage the players to explore the map and farm for resources ( either by searching objects or destroying them with an axe ) used to build the fortifications , weapons , ammunition , and traps needed to defend or attack the husks . Players also frequently need to seek out bluglo , a special resource that does not carry over between maps to activate certain mission objectives . Some missions are considered a loss if the objective is destroyed or time runs out , while other missions allow the players to rework their fortifications and start their defense again if the objective is destroyed . Maps will frequently have optional objectives that are discovered through exploration , such as human survivors that need help . Completing these successfully earn immediate in - game rewards such as resources , weapons , and traps . Missions themselves may provide bonus objectives , such as by completing the mission within a certain in - game period , using a limited number of fortification pieces , or saving more survivors than the minimum necessary , which affects the qualify of rewards the players receive after the successful completion of the main mission . </P> <P> During missions , players can make their fortifications from one of three base materials ( wood , brick , and metal ) , and in a number of configurations , including floors / ceilings , walls , stairs , and ramps ; players have the ability to edit these for more configurations , such as adding a door or window to a wall . Each fortification part can be upgraded with more resources of the same type to improve their durability , and when they are damaged , can be repaired by spending additional resources . Traps , which have a limited number of activation before they fall apart , can be placed on floors , walls , and ceilings , and arranged in means to make them more lethal or effective against husks . Traps may also include beneficial resources for players , such as healing pads , defender posts , and launch pads . Similarly , players can use a range of weapons but these have limited durability that drops as they are used or as a penalty if the player should be downed by husks and need to respawn without the help of allies . Players can construct new weapons , ammo , and traps from gathered resources , or find these from searching containers across the map . During missions , the game progresses through an accelerated day - night cycle ; during the day , the husks are more passive and do not generally pose immediate threats , while during the night , bands of husks may spawn in and will aggressively seek out players . </P> <P> One unique mission type is Storm Shield Defense missions . In each of the four world locations , the player is allocated a map that remains persistent , representing the site where their base 's storm shield generator is placed , and in the storm mode , the player must return to this map to expand the storm shield , requiring them to add a new objective to defend successfully to continue the story . At any time , the player can enter this map without starting the defense mission , and use their carried - over resources to build out the fortification and traps , or add resources to a special storage area for this map . </P> <P> Fortnite is also able to offer themed - events with a unique progression line , new locations , and rewards based on those themes . The first such event was its Halloween event , `` Fortnitemares '' , that offered Halloween - themed heroes , characters , weapons , and traps ( usable outside of the event ) by completing numerous objectives . </P> <H2> Development </H2> <H3> History </H3> <P> Fortnite was first revealed at the 2011 Spike Video Game Awards ( VGA ) , with Epic 's former design director Cliff Bleszinski introducing a trailer for the game . Donald Mustard , creative lead at Epic , said in 2017 that this announcement was `` three weeks after we came up with the idea , before we even made the game '' . The title , which started out as an internal game jam project , represents a departure from the company 's previous work . As Bleszinski explained during the Spike event , Epic wanted to `` switch things up a little bit and do something different and fun '' with Fortnite , describing it as `` a world where you explore , you scavenge , you build and ultimately you survive . '' In an interview with Engadget , he also echoed these statements , claiming that the game would be different from the Gears of War series : `` There 's no dudebros in it ... Not that there 's anything wrong with that , right ? But creatively for the team , Gears has been amazing for us . But it 's fun to kind of stretch our wings and do something that 's a little different from the usual . '' Epic Games Vice President of Publishing Mike Fischer said in 2015 that Epic recognized that they `` announced this game too soon '' , and that its lengthy development period was due to `` very good reasons . '' </P> <P> As the game was at its very preliminary stages at the VGA reveal , the goal of this reveal was to seek public interest in the title and potential publishing partners as to decide on the game 's release platforms and timeframe . During the July 2012 San Diego Comic Con , Epic announced that Fortnite would be an exclusive personal computer title , and the first one to be developed by Epic using their new Unreal 4 game engine , with a planned release in 2013 . The game 's development was originally started in the Unreal 3 engine , but as they progressed , they had seen the opportunity to work in several of the new feature sets and scripting language offered by Unreal 4 for Fortnite , while still running on most personal computers at that time . They further opted for personal computer exclusivity to avoid the difficulty of having to go through console certification , and as they planned to be constantly monitoring and tweaking the game , acting as a dungeon master , the personal computer approach would allow them to do this without restrictions normally set by console manfuctures . Bleszinski later clarified that they would not rule out release on other platforms as they developed the title . </P> Fortnite cosplayers at Gamescom 2017 <P> Fortnite 's development was spread among several of Epic 's satellite studios , and was also co-developed by the Polish studio People Can Fly , which had worked with Epic previously on earlier games , and had been fully acquired by Epic sometime in 2012 . People Can Fly were briefly renamed Epic Games Poland in 2013 as to align with Epic 's other studios . By March 2014 , there were about 90 developers working on the game . People Can Fly later returned to being an independent studio and their own name in 2015 , but continued to help Epic with Fortnite 's development . </P> <P> During Fortnite 's development , Epic had seen the game industry shifting to games as a service model . To help with this transition , the company brought in Tencent who had several games operating under this model . As part of this agreement , Tencent bought a significant share of ownership in Epic Games through stock acquisition around June 2012 . The shifting of Epic 's approach through Tencent led to the departure of some high - level staff later that year , including Bleszinski . Fortnite was seen as the spearhead for Epic 's games - as - a-service model as they collaborated with Tencent . This caused some road bumps in the development of Fortnite , according to Mustard . Fortnite 's development was also slowed as it was used as the testing ground for the new features of the Unreal 4 engine . </P> <P> By November 2013 , Epic confirmed that Fortnite would not release that year , nor offered a target released date , though affirmed the game was still in development by several of its studios . Fortnite was a feature in the May 2014 issue of Game Informer , revealing that the title would be released as a free - to - play game . </P> <P> By 2014 , Fortnite was at a `` pretty functional prototype '' with most of the Unreal 4 engine elements smoothed out , according to Mustard . Epic anticipated it would still take about three more years to complete , not only in polishing and balancing the game , but setting in place the necessary backend elements for the games - as - a-service model . To help support development and get player feedback , Epic used a series of closed alpha test periods . The game 's first closed alpha , called Online Test 1 , ran from December 2 to 19 , 2014 , while Online Test 2 ran from March 24 to April 14 , 2015 . Epic said the first alpha was designed to help it `` make sure all of our basic systems are working '' and establish `` a baseline for how people play in order to make Fortnite better . '' After being demoed at WWDC 2015 on Mac , Fortnite entered closed beta testing in the fall of 2015 . Approximately 50,000 players participated in these periods . </P> <P> Fortnite was being developed alongside Paragon , which Epic announced on November 2015 . As Paragon seemed to take Epic 's focus , leaving little news about Fortnite , CEO Tim Sweeney said in March 2016 that they were still committed to Fortnite once Paragon was launched and established , given that much of the work on Fortnite would take time to get the right balance for gameplay . `` We figure we should start with one major successful launch and do one at a time . Fortnite will be next . '' </P> <P> By June 2017 , Epic Games announced that Fortnite was now set for a 2018 release across Windows , macOS , and the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles . Leading up to this free - to - play release , the game was offered as a paid early access period starting on July 25 , 2017 for all platforms ; players who pre-ordered Founder 's Packs were granted access to the game on July 21 . The lengthy period since the game 's alpha phases was ascribed to developing Fortnite as a games - as - a-service model , according to creative lead Donald Mustard . While the game had been in a playable state for the two years before this , Epic wanted to be able to develop ongoing content to players to keep them interested in the title , such as planning timed events with unique rewards , following in the approach used by games like League of Legends and Warframe . Since the game had already been announced earlier in 2014 through Game Informer , Epic opted not to use their Electronic Entertainment Expo time or space in June 2017 to re-announce the game , fearing that coverage of it would be lost in the deluge of other gaming news coming out of the event . Instead , the Epic marketing team worked with Twitch and other game streamers to provide them early copies of the game to play and promote on their channels in the weeks leading up to their target release date of July 25 , 2017 . However , a few weeks before this date , Epic recognized that the game was still not ready for release ; it was playable but not content complete . Rather than prolonging it further , Epic decided to release the game into paid early access on July 25 , 2017 , which would also allow them to get active feedback on the game as they progressed in development . At the time of the start of early access , Gearbox Software helped distribute the game on physical media . </P> <P> With the popularity of Fortnite Battle Royale , which was first released in early access around September 2017 and gained considerable attention by early 2018 , Epic split off a separate development team to focus on improvements for this mode . Epic said that their attention to Fortnite was causing some of their other games to see lower player populations , leading them to reduce development efforts on these games , particularly Paragon . By the end of January 2018 , Epic announced it was shutting down Paragon by April of that year , providing refunds to all players . Players on a Fortnite - dedicated Reddit forum had expressed concerns that a similar fate could befall the Save the World mode of Fortnite , as externally , the Save the World mode has not received the same attention in providing updates and improvements compared to the Battle Royale mode since that mode 's release . Epic 's Ed Zobrist said that as of March 2018 that the retention rates for `` Save the World '' have been high , and have grown since the release of Fortnite Battle Royale , and the company has since improved communications with the player base , such as providing development road maps and known bug lists . </P> <H3> Art and design </H3> <P> In their initial prototypes of the game , Epic had used creepier and darker designs for the husks and other enemies . Bleszinski said that they found this to create an `` exhaustive environment '' that was too grim , and designed to take the design in a more cartoonish approach , while still remaining creepy , so that players would enjoy spending time in the game 's world , without competing with games like DayZ . They used works from Pixar , Tim Burton , and Looney Tunes as inspiration for the designs . </P> <P> Fortnite uses procedural generation to build out the maps for each mission . The game also includes an `` AI director '' that monitors how players are progressing , and alters the challenges of the monsters it sends out to the players based on that progression , easing off if players are having greater difficulty in surviving . At one point , the game had a team - based player versus player mode , where each side attempted to build up a base around a central target while trying to attack the opponent 's target after breaking through their base . This did not make it into the final game . </P> <P> Epic currently has cross-platform play between PC and PS4 and has stated plans to allow separate Fortnite cross-platform support for Xbox One and personal computer users , but cross-platform play between all three platforms has not been announced . However , for a few hours during one day in September 2017 , players found they could cross-play between all three platforms . Epic later corrected this , calling it a `` configuration error '' . </P> <H2> Reception </H2> <H3> Sales </H3> <P> On July 26 , 2017 , it was announced that Fortnite had sold over 500,000 digital pre-order copies . On August 18 , 2017 , Epic confirmed that Fortnite had surpassed over a million players . </P> <H3> Accolades </H3> <P> Eurogamer ranked the game 32nd on their list of the `` Top 50 Games of 2017 '' . It was also nominated for `` Best Co-op Game '' in PC Gamer 's 2017 Game of the Year Awards , and for `` Best Spectator Game '' in IGN 's Best of 2017 Awards . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> </Th> <Th> Result </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> The Game Awards 2017 </Td> <Td> Best Multiplayer </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2018 </Td> <Td> 16th Visual Effects Society Awards </Td> <Td> Outstanding Visual Effects in a Real - Time Project ( A Hard Day 's Night ) </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> D.I.C.E.

It is regarded as one of China 's three golden ages ( the other two being the Han and Song periods ) . The period was marked by the increasing political influence of the merchants , the gradual weakening of imperial rule , and technological advances . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Currency </Li> <Li> 2 Manufactures <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Privatization </Li> <Li> 2.2 Emergence of wage labor </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Early encouragement of agriculture under Hongwu <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Emergence of commercial plantations </Li> <Li> 3.2 Rural markets during the Ming </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Trade and investment <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Taxation </Li> <Li> 4.2 Weakening of the state </Li> <Li> 4.3 Sprouts of capitalism </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Currency ( edit ) </H2> Further information : Ming dynasty coinage <P> The early Ming dynasty attempted to use paper currency , with outflows of bullion limited by its ban on private foreign commerce . Like its forebears , the currency experienced massive counterfeiting and hyperinflation . ( In 1425 , Ming notes were trading at about 0.014 % of its original value under the Hongwu Emperor . ) The notes remained in circulation as late as 1573 but their printing was ended in 1450 . Minor coins were minted in base metals , but trade mostly occurred using silver ingots . As their purity and exact weight varied , they were treated as bullion and measured in tael . These privately made `` sycee '' first came into use in Guangdong , spreading to the lower Yangtze sometime before 1423 , the year it became acceptable for payment of tax obligations . In the mid-15th century , the paucity of circulating silver caused a monetary contraction and extensive reversion to barter . The problem was met through smuggled , then legal , importation of Japanese silver ( mostly through the Portuguese and Dutch ) and Spanish silver from Potosí carried on the Manila galleons . Provincial taxes were required to be paid in silver in 1465 ; the salt tax , in 1475 ; and corvée exemptions , in 1485 . By the late Ming , the amount of silver being used was extraordinary : at a time when English traders considered tens of thousands of pounds an exceptional fortune , the Zheng clan of merchants regularly engaged in transactions valued at millions of taels . However , a second silver contraction occurred in the mid-17th century when King Philip IV began enforcing laws limiting direct trade between Spanish South America and China at about the same time the new Tokugawa shogunate in Japan restricted most of its foreign exports , cutting off Dutch and Portuguese access to its silver . The dramatic spike in silver 's value in China made payment of taxes nearly impossible for most provinces . In extremis , the government even resumed use of paper currency amid Li Zicheng 's rebellion . </P> <H2> Manufactures ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Privatization ( edit ) </H3> <P> Another key feature of the Ming manufacturing industry was privatization . Unlike the Song , in which state - owned enterprises played a large role , the Ming reverted to the old laissez faire policies of the Han by privatizing the salt and tea industries . By the middle of the Ming dynasty , powerful groups of wealthy merchants had replaced the state as the dominant movers behind Chinese industry . </P> <H3> Emergence of wage labor ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Ming government abolished the mandatory forced labor by peasants used in early dynasties and replaced it with wage labor . A new class of wage laborers sprung up where none had existed before . In Jingde alone , it was reported that there were no less than 300 pottery factories , all operated by wage laborers . </P> <H2> Early encouragement of agriculture under Hongwu ( edit ) </H2> <P> In order to recover from rule of the Mongols and the wars that followed them , the Hongwu Emperor enacted pro-agricultural policies . The state invested extensively in agricultural canals , reduced taxes on agriculture to 1 / 30 of the output , and later to 1.5 % of agricultural output . Ming farmers also introduced many innovations such as water - powered plows , and new agricultural methods such as crop rotation . This led to a massive agricultural surplus that became the basis of a market economy . </P> <H3> Emergence of commercial plantations ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Ming saw the rise of commercial plantations who produced crops suitable to their regions . Tea , fruits , paint and other goods were produced on a massive scale by these agricultural plantations . Regional patterns of production established during this period continued into the Qing dynasty . The Columbian exchange brought crops such as corn with these foreign crops . During the Ming , specialized areas also popped up planting large numbers of cash crops that could be sold at markets . Large numbers of peasants abandoned the land to become artisans . The population of the Ming boomed ; estimates for the population of the Ming range from 160 to 200 million . </P> <H3> Rural markets during the Ming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ming agriculture was much changed from the earlier areas ; firstly , gigantic areas , devoting and specializing in cash crops , sprung up to demand from the new market economy . Secondly , agricultural tools and carts , some water - powered , help to create a gigantic agricultural surplus which formed the basis of the rural economy . Besides rice , other crops were grown on a large scale . </P> <P> Although images of autarkic farmers who had no connection to the rest of China may have some merit for the earlier Han and T'ang dynasties , this was certainly not the case for the Ming dynasty . During the Ming dynasty , the increase in population and the decrease in quality land made it necessary that farmers make a living off cash crops . Many of these markets appeared in the rural countryside , where goods were exchanged and bartered . </P> <P> A second type of market that developed in China was the urban - rural type , in which rural goods were sold to urban dwellers . This was particular the case when landlords decided to reside in the cities , and use income coming from rural land holding to facilitate exchange in the cities . Another way this type of market was used was professional merchants who bought rural goods in large quantities . </P> <P> The third type of market was the `` national market '' which was developed during the Song dynasty but particularly enhanced during the Ming . This market involved not only the exchange described above , but also products produced directly for the market . Unlike earlier dynasties , many Ming peasants were no longer producing only products they needed ; many of them produced products for the market , which then they sold at a profit . </P> <H2> Trade and investment ( edit ) </H2> Main article : Haijin <P> In the early Ming , after the devastation of the war which expelled the Mongols , the Hongwu Emperor imposed severe restrictions on trade ( the `` haijin '' ) . Believing that agriculture was the basis of the economy , Hongwu favored that industry over all else , including that of merchants . After his death , most of his policies were reversed by his successors . By the late Ming , the state was losing power to the very merchants which Hongwu had wanted to restrict . </P> <P> The Ming dynasty also engaged in a thriving trade with both Europe and Japan . The amount of silver flowing into the Ming dynasty was estimated by Joseph Needham at 300 million taels , which is equivalent to more than 190 billion dollars in today 's money . In addition to silver , the Ming also imported many European firearms , in order to ensure the modernness of their weapons . </P> <P> Trade and commerce thrived in this liberalized economy , and was aided by the construction of canals , roads , and bridges by the Ming government . The Ming saw the rise of several merchant clans such as the Huai and Jin clans , who disposed of large amounts of wealth . The gentry and merchant classes started to fuse , and the merchants gained power at the expense of the state . Some merchants were reputed to have a treasure of 30 million taels . </P> <H3> Taxation ( edit ) </H3> <P> Ming taxation was light . Taxes on agriculture were only 1 / 30 of agricultural produce , and were later reduced to 1 / 50 of produce . Taxes on commerce amounted to 1 / 30 of commerce also , but was later reduced to 1.5 % . These low taxes spurred trade , but severely weakened the state . Salt , as in earlier dynasties , was an important source of state revenue , but required constant and competent management . With the coming of the Little Ice Age in the 17th century , the state 's low revenues and its inability to raise taxes caused massive deficits , and large numbers of Ming troops defected or rebelled because they had not been paid . </P> <H3> Weakening of the state ( edit ) </H3> <P> During the Ming , the controls imposed on the economy were gradually relaxed . State monopolies on salt and iron ended as these and other industries were privatized . Taxes were reduced from the high levels under the Mongol Yuan , and the Ming had one of the lowest tax rates ( per person ) in the world . The entire foreign trade , which was estimated at up to 300 million taels , provided the Ming with a tax of only about 40,000 taels a year . When the Wanli Emperor sought to increase the salt tax , his measures were opposed by violence and the eunuchs he sent to collect the tax were beheaded by local officials . </P> <H3> Sprouts of capitalism ( edit ) </H3> <P> Investment and capital moved off the land and were poured into ventures . Continuing the trend from the Song , Ming investors poured large amounts of capital into ventures and reaped high profits . Many Chinese scholars believe the Ming was the dynasty in which the `` sprouts of capitalism '' emerged in China , only to be suppressed by the Qing Dynastry . This theory was widely promoted by Communist scholars during the Maoist period , and suffers from that period 's general condemnation of the Manchu Qing , who were accused of mis - managing the Chinese state in the face of foreign encroachment . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Economic history of China </Li> <Li> Economy of the Han dynasty </Li> <Li> Economy of the Song dynasty </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Von Glahn , Richard ( 1996 ) , Fountain of Fortune : Money and Monetary Policy in China , 1000 -- 1700 , Berkeley : University of California Press , pp. 90 -- 1 , ISBN 0 - 520 - 20408 - 5 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Fairbank , John K. ; et al.
